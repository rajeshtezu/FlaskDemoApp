# FlaskDemoApp
A small flask website with two page. Created while learning flask framework and how to deploy on live server.

Currently this website contains only a navigation menu and some text with css styling. I will later add form functionality with
validation, authentication etc features such as signup, login etc.  

Just to test how to start with Flask you can follow these steps  

### Create virtual environment
```
$virtualenv flaskVirEnv
$cd flaskVirEnv
$source bin/activate
```

### Install Flask framework
```
(flaskVirEnv)$pip3 install flask
```
### Clone the project
```
(flaskVirEnv)$git clone https://github.com/rajeshtezu90/FlaskDemoApp.git
```
### Install requirements
```
(flaskVirEnv)$pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
### Launch the website
```
(flaskVirEnv)$python3 script1.py
```
Now visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/

I have depolyed it on a live server. You can visit below link to have a look
